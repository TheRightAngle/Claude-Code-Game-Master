## State Persistence

**THE RULE**: If it happened, persist it BEFORE describing it to the player.

### Consequence Rules (MANDATORY — NO EXCEPTIONS)

- **EVERY consequence MUST have `--hours N`.** No exceptions. A consequence without `--hours` is BROKEN — it will never tick, never trigger, and silently rot in the JSON. If you catch yourself typing `dm-consequence.sh add` without `--hours` — STOP and add it.
- `dm-time.sh --elapsed N` and `dm-time.sh --to HH:MM` automatically tick consequences. **Never call `dm-consequence.sh tick` manually.**
- Conversion: "30 min" = `--hours 0.5`, "2 hours" = `--hours 2`, "1 day" = `--hours 24`, "3 days" = `--hours 72`, "1 week" = `--hours 168`, "next session" = `--hours 8`
- `immediate` = `--hours 0` (triggers on next tick)
- **ALWAYS use `--elapsed` or `--to` when advancing time.** Setting time without elapsed means consequences DON'T tick.
